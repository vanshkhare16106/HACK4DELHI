# Smart Parking Capacity Enforcement System

## Overview
The Smart Parking Capacity Enforcement System is an AI-based solution designed to monitor parking lots in real time, prevent overcapacity violations, and improve accountability for Municipal Corporations.

The system automatically detects vehicles, identifies entry and exit events, maintains a live vehicle count, enforces parking capacity limits, and sends automatic alerts to authorities when violations occur.

## Problem Statement
Municipal parking areas are often managed by private contractors.  
Many contractors exceed the permitted parking capacity to increase revenue, leading to:

- Traffic congestion  
- Safety hazards  
- Revenue loss for authorities  
- Lack of transparency and enforcement  

Current systems rely on manual checks, which are slow, error-prone, and easy to manipulate.

## Solution
This project provides a **real-time, automated, and tamper-resistant parking enforcement system** that:

- Detects vehicles using AI  
- Automatically counts vehicles entering and exiting  
- Enforces a predefined parking capacity  
- Sends email alerts to authorities when capacity is exceeded  
- Displays live parking status for monitoring  

---

## Key Features
- Real-time vehicle detection using **YOLO11n**
- Automatic ENTRY and EXIT detection using line-crossing logic
- Live vehicle counting with capacity enforcement
- Email alerts for capacity violations
- On-screen visual feedback
- Dashboard for monitoring parking status
- Modular and scalable system design

## System Architecture
The system follows this pipeline:

1. Camera captures live video  
2. YOLO11n detects vehicles in each frame  
3. Line crossing logic determines ENTRY or EXIT  
4. Vehicle counter updates current count  
5. Capacity checker detects violations  
6. Email alert is sent to authorities  
7. Dashboard displays live status  

---

## How It Works
1. The camera continuously captures frames.
2. Vehicles are detected using YOLO11n.
3. A virtual line determines whether a vehicle is entering or exiting.
4. The system updates the vehicle count accordingly.
5. If the count exceeds the allowed capacity:
   - A violation is detected
   - An email alert is sent automatically
6. Live status is displayed on screen and dashboard.
